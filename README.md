Defects4J -- version 1.1.0
----------------
Defects4J is a collection of reproducible bugs collected with the goal of
advancing software testing research.

The projects
---------------
Defects4J contains 395 bugs from the following open-source projects:

| Identifier | Project name         | Number of bugs |
|------------|----------------------|----------------|
| Chart      | JFreechart           |  26            |
| Closure    | Closure compiler     | 133            |
| Lang       | Apache commons-lang  |  65            |
| Math       | Apache commons-math  | 106            |
| Mockito    | Mockito              |  38            |
| Time       | Joda-Time            |  27            |

The bugs
---------------
Each bug has the following properties:

- Issue filed in the corresponding issue tracker, and issue tracker identifier
  mentioned in the fixing commit message.
- Fixed in a single commit -- manually verified to not include irrelevant
  changes (e.g., refactorings or feature additions).
- Fixed by modifying the source code (as opposed to configuration files,
  documentation, or test files).
- A triggering test exists that failed before the fix and passes after the fix
  -- the test failure is not random or dependent on test execution order.

(B)uggy and (f)ixed program revisions are labelled with `<id>b` and `<id>f`,
respectively (`<id>` is an integer).

Requirements
----------------
 - Java 1.7
 - Perl >= 5.0.10
 - Git >= 1.9
 - SVN >= 1.8

All bugs have been reproduced and triggering tests verified, using the latest
version of Java 1.7.
Note that using Java 1.8+ might result in unexpected failing tests on a fixed
program version. The next major release of Defects4J will be compatible with
Java 8.

Defects4J generates and executes tests in the timezone `America/Los_Angeles`.
If you are using the bugs outside of the Defects4J framework, export the `TZ`
environment variable accordingly.

Getting started
----------------
#### Setting up Defects4J
1. Clone Defects4J:
    - `git clone https://github.com/rjust/defects4j`

2. Initialize Defects4J (download the project repositories and external libraries, which are not included in the git repository for size purposes and to avoid redundancies):
    - `cd defects4j`
    - `./init.sh`

3. Add Defects4J's executables to your PATH:
    - `export PATH=$PATH:"path2defects4j"/framework/bin`

#### Using Defects4J
4. Check installation and get information for a specific project (commons lang):
    - `defects4j info -p Lang`

5. Get information for a specific bug (commons lang, bug 1):
    - `defects4j info -p Lang -b 1`

6. Checkout a buggy source code version (commons lang, bug 1, buggy version):
    - `defects4j checkout -p Lang -v 1b -w /tmp/lang_1_buggy`

7. Change to the working directory, compile sources and tests, and run tests:
    - `cd /tmp/lang_1_buggy`
    - `defects4j compile`
    - `defects4j test`

8. More examples of how to use the framework are available in `framework/test`

directory to export a version-specific property:
